       My name is Lamar Reliford I am a 24 year old coding bootcamp student at UCR. I started my education journey at Riverside Community College as a kinesiology major but quickly realized it wasnt the major for me. As a result of my realization I switched my major to business which instrested me since a lot of people i know own businesses. However I ended up taking a break from school to focus on work and educating myself. In my pursuit of new opportunity I
    stumbled across coding and have been instrested in growing in this field.
    I already learned some html from some free sites that I found online but never got around to finish learning this
    skill.
